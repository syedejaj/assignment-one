            <h1>Let's Help Those Who Are <br> More In Need</h1>
            <p>If in my youth I had realized that the sustaining splendour of beauty of with which I was in love would
                one
                day
                flood back into my heart, there to ignite a flame that would torture me without end, how gladly would I
                have put
                out the light in my eyes.</p>

            <p>As I grew older it seemed that I was not making a big enough difference, particularly given my own
                incredible
                good fortune. I went from feeling content that things were going well, to realizing that I hadnt even
                begun
                to scratch the surface of what needed to be done.</p>

                <h3>Food for a Family</h3>
                <p>The table is a meeting place, a gathering ground, the source of sustenance and nourishment,
                    festivity,
                    safety, and satisfaction. A person cooking is a person giving: Even the simplest food is a gift</p>

                <h3>Shelter for a Family</h3>
                <p>Heads up, it might be in your bathroom or something. I’m lucky that mine is toward the front of my
                    house right off the kitchen. I like to stand parallel to the window with my food in between and take
                    the photo at a 45 degree angle. This gives the food a nice, sparkle effect.</p>
